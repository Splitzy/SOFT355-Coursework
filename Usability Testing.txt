What did you like about the product?
"It's pretty good! It works, it seems pretty robust (you can change your option and it uses whatever you last chose, so that's good)"

What didn't you like about the project/what would you improve?
"The wins/losses thing doesn't seem to do anything though, and I don't exactly know how you'd fix this but once you start moving past the limit of the text box and it starts scrolling
you have to scroll each time to see what the next result is. 
If you have a way of identifying who's player 1 and 2, I would add a little "Player <x>:" next to their chat so you can work out who sent what"

User 2:
What did you like about the product?
"itâ€™s very simple n easy to use"

What didn't you like about the project/what would you improve?
"Maybe like an indication of player 1 or player 2 and it says who sent what on the chat"

User 3:
What did you like about the product?
"it seems to work, draws work and winning and losing messages seem correct"

What didn't you like about the project/what would you improve?
"The wins and losses score tracker doesnt work and the chat window doesnt scroll automatically when the chat updates.
Not having the game rely only on the textbox to convey information would be great too"
